# Customer Travel Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and Customer Attrition Prediction

## Dataset Overview

- Dataset: [Customer Travel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/tour-travels-customer-churn-prediction)
- Source: Kaggle
- Description: This dataset is provided by a tour & travels app and contains information about their customers. Each record includes features such as frequent flyer status, income class, service usage frequency, social media synchronization, app usage for hotel bookings, and churn status.

- Total Records: 954
- Columns: 7
- Initial Missing Values: 60
- Refined Dataset: 894 rows after cleaning and preprocessing

## Data Analysis and Correlation Analysis

- Conducted data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the customer travel dataset.
- Explored the distribution and relationships between different features.
- Performed correlation analysis to identify significant correlations between variables.

## Customer Attrition Prediction

- Used supervised machine learning algorithms to predict customer attrition.
- Goal: Predict churn status (label=1) vs. active customers (label=0) based on available features.
- Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, xgboost, statsmodels.api, among others.

## Conclusion

- Explored the customer travel dataset and performed customer attrition prediction using machine learning techniques.
- Analyzed the dataset, identified patterns, and correlations to understand customer behavior in the tour and travels industry.
- Developed machine learning models to identify potential churners and guide retention strategies.
